## About
In just two weeks, around 22 emails have flooded your inbox as well.
To de-clutter our inbox, we've developed MISSING PIECES to provide a platform for such query/problem.

## Usage
Initializing project by installing dependencies
```
npm i
```
Staring local server
```
npm start
```
Note: We were unable to implement several of the features that we had envisioned at the outset due to a lack of time.
## To-do
- [ ] UI enhancement
- [ ] Notification feature
- [ ] DM optoins to contact any user
- [ ] Categorizing feed of the basis of type of object lost or found
- [ ] After login, screen is not refreshing (Bug)
